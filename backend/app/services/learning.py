"""Importance learning: turn the user's accept/dismiss/snooze/act behavior into
a per-user adjustment that the priority ranker mixes in.

The shape is intentionally simple. We track two things per user:

  - per-sender adjustment: +act counts and -dismiss counts, capped so a single
    enthusiastic week doesn't permanently lock a sender into "critical".
  - per-category adjustment: same shape but for keyword categories (money,
    legal, ask, meeting). When the user repeatedly dismisses money-flagged
    items but acts on meeting-flagged items, the ranker drifts toward what
    the user actually cares about.

Storage lives in user.preferences under "learning" so we don't need a
migration. The data is per-user, not per-org, and the shape is small enough
to fit comfortably in a JSON column (~hundreds of keys at most for any real
user; commodity Postgres handles that fine).

Updates are idempotent on event id — the same act/dismiss can't double-count
if a worker re-runs."""
