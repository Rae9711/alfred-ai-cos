"""Capability registry. Maps an ActionType to its provider. The execution service
looks providers up here; routes never touch providers directly.

Registering a capability here is the single switch that turns it on. Refused
capabilities (browser, delivery) are registered to providers that raise with a
documented reason rather than being absent, so the seam is explicit."""
