// Vitest config for the mobile app's pure-logic unit tests. These tests cover the
// UI-free modules (src/lib, the deterministic helpers in ui/data) without a React
// Native runtime, so no native-module mocks are needed. Screen render tests would
// require jest-expo; this config deliberately stays light.
//
// Exception: .test.tsx files opt into jsdom per-file (// @vitest-environment jsdom)
// to exercise pure-React pieces like CompanionAvatarProvider — still no RN runtime.
